The Chatbot's primary objective is to recommend songs tailored to the emotional tone of the ongoing conversation between the user and the Chatbot. By utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques and integrating with music recommendation services, our Chatbot will offer a personalized and engaging musical experience that perfectly aligns with the user's emotions and preferences.
